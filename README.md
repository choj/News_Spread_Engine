# Ticker Selection Prompt

**Date**: 2025-08-20 18:17 PDT

## 1. Universe & Selection (9 points)
1. **Pick Stocks**: Select 3 stocks/sector (27 total) from CSVs (xlc, xle, xlf, xli, xlp, xlk, xlv, xlu) for 0‚Äì33 DTE credit spreads.
2. **Show Table**: Build table: Sector | Ticker | News Heat | IV % | Open Interest. Sort by sector (A‚ÄìZ), News Heat (high-low).
3. **Set Rules**: Include pin=[...] if safe, exclude ban=[...]. Pick U.S. stocks, skip ADRs <500K volume.
4. **Grab Data**: Use IR, SEC, DOJ/FTC/FDA, Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ, Nasdaq, Yahoo, Tastytrade (IV, OI). Skip unverified rumors.
5. **Vary Picks**: Mix sector themes (e.g., XLE: major, service, renewable) and sizes (large, mid, small cap).
6. **Plan B**: If <3 stocks with News Heat ‚â•1000, use CSV weights, then market cap, alphabetical.
7. **Dodge Volatility**: Skip >8% daily moves unless News Heat ‚â•3500.
8. **Aim Big**: Favor >$2B market cap stocks unless pinned.
9. **Track Picks**: Log skips (e.g., ‚ÄúAAPL: earnings soon‚Äù), headline, timestamp, source, News Heat.

## 2. News & Scoring (6 points)
1. **Hunt News**: Fetch data (‚â§72h, best ‚â§24h): filings, launches, mergers, CEO shifts, buybacks, regulators, Fed/CPI, analyst notes, lawsuits.
2. **Score Heat**: Set top score: 4000 (merger), 3500 (product, regulatory), 1500 (analyst, buyback, contract), 1200 (lawsuit, strike), 500 (minor), 0 (none). Cut 200 for >24h. Need ‚â•1000 for news.
3. **Block Risks**: Skip earnings in 0‚Äì33 DTE, macro ‚â§5 days (Fed/CPI/OPEC/FDA), dividends ‚â§5 days.
4. **Tastytrade Check**: Filter IV % 50‚Äì80, OI >500/strike (Tastytrade, 0‚Äì33 DTE options).
5. **Stay Tight**: Use live, timestamped sources. Merge same-event links. Clash = no news. Max 2 same-news/sector.
6. **Max Edge**: Favor high IV, News Heat for premium, catalyst-driven trades.

## 3. Execution & Output (3 points)
1. **Move Quick**: Spend ~60s/sector. Timeout ‚Üí backups (‚Äútimeout‚Äù). Check halts, bankruptcies (24h).
2. **Make Table**: Show table: Sector | Ticker | News Heat | IV % | Open Interest. Sort sector (A‚ÄìZ), News Heat (high-low).
3. **Log It**: Save skips, headlines, timestamps, sources, News Heat.
```  

## ‚ñ™Ô∏è Instructions  

```text
Run & order:
1. Print the exact PDT date/time at the top.
2. pend up to ~60 seconds per sector; if time‚Äôs up, fill with ETF-weight fallbacks.
3. Sort output: Sector (A‚ÜíZ) ‚Üí NHSU (high‚Üílow) ‚Üí ETF weight ‚Üí alphabetical.

Universe controls
1. You can pass pin=[...] (must include unless hard-stopped) and ban=[...] (never include).
2. Use primary U.S. listings; skip thin ADRs.

Sources (quality filter)
1. Prefer company IR/SEC/regulators/courts/index providers ‚Üí then major wires (Reuters/AP/Bloomberg/WSJ/FT) ‚Üí then big finance sites.
2. Auto-exclude rumor words (‚Äúreportedly/may/could/considering‚Äù) unless later confirmed.
3. If two reputable sources conflict, treat as no news.
4. Count multiple links about the same event as one catalyst.

Heat scoring tweaks
1. Freshness decay: news >24h to ‚â§72h = ‚Äì200 NHSU (still needs ‚â•1000 to qualify).
2. IV boost (+500) only if a credible source quantifies IV and the event is ‚â§5 trading days away; remove after it passes.
3. Per sector, max 2 picks with the same catalyst type (don‚Äôt pick three upgrades).

Events & macro (gates)
1. Earnings inside 0‚Äì33 DTE = exclude.
2. Confirmed dated macro inside ~5 trading days (Fed/CPI/Jobs, OPEC/EIA, notable FDA) that directly hits the name = exclude or deprioritize.
3. Ex-div within 5 trading days = exclude.

Price-action sanity
1. If today‚Äôs move is > ¬±8%, skip unless Heat is 3500/4000.
2. Avoid unconfirmed premarket gaps >3% (when premarket data is visible).

Safety checks
1. Re-check for trading halts, bankruptcies, delistings in the last 24h before finalizing.
2. If there‚Äôs an active agency probe with unknown timing inside DTE, deprioritize unless a date is set.

Diversity
1. Mix sub-themes within each sector (e.g., Energy = 1 major, 1 services, 1 pipeline/renewable) when choices exist.
2. Don‚Äôt stack highly correlated mega-caps across sectors if viable alternatives exist.

Fallback discipline
1. When using fallback, don‚Äôt add catalyst text; pick by ETF weight (then market cap, then alpha).
2. If a pinned name hits a hard stop, skip it (don‚Äôt force it).
3. Light audit (for your logs, not the table)
4. Keep a tiny note per pick: headline, timestamp, source, NHSU, IV boost yes/no.
5. Note why top-weight names were skipped (e.g., earnings in window, rumor-only, >72h).

## ‚ñ™Ô∏è Prompt for Credit Spread Results vs Market Reality

```text
Date: [enter date & time]

Universe (must use): Only credit spreads from final_credit_spread_comparison.json (has AI = GPT/Grok).

Goal (must do): Validate each 0‚Äì45 DTE spread against current market reality.
Check for risks that could blow up the trade; base on real-time facts only, no guesses or assumptions.
Output: Table only ‚Äî AI Bot Name | Ticker | Type | Legs| DTE | PoP | ROI | Current Risk | Final Status ‚Äî one row per spread | heat score 
Sort by ticker alphabetically; use bold for Critical/High risks.


What to fetch now (real-time, verifiable):
1. Earnings collision: Company IR pages, earnings calendars from Nasdaq/Yahoo Finance/Seeking Alpha/Zacks, analyst calls/transcripts, quiet period ends (next 45 days; include guidance updates, pre-announcements, post-earnings drifts).
2. Major news catalysts: Press releases, 8-K/6-K filings, conference presentations/speeches, product launches/recalls, mergers/acquisitions/deals, executive changes/hirings/firings, dividend announcements/changes, stock splits/buybacks (‚â§ 72h).

5. Trading anomalies: Exchange halts/suspensions/delists, circuit breakers triggered, unusual volume (top 1% today or >300% avg), short squeezes/float data, options expiration effects/pin risks (today or next session), dark pool activity spikes.
6. Technical red flags: >8% price move today without confirmed catalyst, gap opens/closes >5%, 52-week high/low breaks, volatility spikes (VIX >30 or stock IV >50% or >2x avg), analyst downgrades/upgrades/ratings changes (today), RSI overbought/oversold extremes.
7. Sector impacts: Industry-specific events like oil inventory reports (EIA/API), semiconductor tariffs/chip shortages, crypto regulations/bans/halvings, airline safety probes/incidents (FAA), banking stress tests (Fed), real estate data (housing starts/mortgages) (‚â§ 72h).

Hard rules (binary, pass/fail):

1. Live, named, timestamped source that names the ticker explicitly; no generic, aggregated, or unnamed data.
2. ‚â§72h max age for news/catalysts; older = no conflict, treat as clean; ignore archived or historical items.
3. Earnings inside DTE = automatic fail (skip entire spread); include any related events like calls or guidance.
4. No speculation; confirmed/documented events only; ignore rumors, unverified tweets/social media, forward-looking opinions, or analyst predictions without facts.
5. Primary > secondary: Company IR/SEC filings ‚Üí Fed/BLS/regulator sites ‚Üí Reuters/Bloomberg/WSJ/AP/CNBC ‚Üí exchange sites (NYSE/Nasdaq) ‚Üí Yahoo Finance/Investing.com/MarketWatch.
6. Verify with multiple sources if conflicting; default to primary if tie; if no data after thorough check, assume low risk but note "clean scan."

Action steps (risk ‚Üí status ‚Üí build): Step 1 ‚Äî Current Risk (pick highest applicable; list all factors briefly in cell):
1. Critical (auto-skip): Earnings in DTE; trading halt/suspension/delisting; bankruptcy filing; fraud probe/SEC halt; CEO arrest/resignation under duress; major lawsuit loss.
2. High: Major catalyst ‚â§24h (e.g., merger vote/close, verdict/settlement); Fed event ‚â§5 days; Price spike >8% today; volume surge >500% avg without cause; IV explosion >100% baseline; short squeeze in play.
3. Medium: Minor catalyst ‚â§72h (e.g., analyst note, small deal, exec change); Macro event 5‚Äì10 days (e.g., jobs/CPI report); Price move 3‚Äì8% today; moderate volume bump 200‚Äì500%; sector news spillover; mild IV rise.
4. Low: Clean news flow; no scheduled events in horizon; normal tape activity; price stable <3% today; standard volume/IV; no flags.

Step 2 ‚Äî Final Status:

1. PROCEED: Low only (safe to enter full size; no issues).
2. MONITOR: Medium (consider smaller size, tighter stops, or hedge; watch closely).
3. SKIP: High or any Critical (avoid entirely; too risky now).
