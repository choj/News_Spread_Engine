## Prompt for News Heat Ticker Picker

```text

Date: [enter date & time]


Universe (must use): Only tickers in the attached CSVs: XLK, XLC, XLY, XLP, XLV, XLF, XLI, XLE, XLU.
Goal (must do): Pick exactly 3 tickers per sector (9 sectors = 27 total) for 0‚Äì33 DTE credit spreads today.


Rules (real-time only, no guesses)
1. Live, timestamped, named-publisher sources that explicitly mention the ticker.
2. If not confirmed now by a primary or two majors (‚â§72h), treat as no news.
3. No IV inference‚Äîno estimates, no history, no options-flow anecdotes.
4. Use IV only when a credible source quantifies it and ties it to a dated event.


Step 1 ‚Äî Score News (‚â§24h preferred; fallback ‚â§72h)
Assign each ticker one News Heat Score Unit (NHSU) from its single strongest, verified ‚â§72h catalyst:
4000 ‚Äî M&A (Definitive) Definitive/signed deal or acknowledged offer posted on IR/SEC or confirmed by 2+ major wires (‚â§24h preferred).
3500 ‚Äî Product / Regulatory (Final) Dated product launch/major event or final regulatory/litigation decision (SEC/FDA/court) with a clear effective date.
1500 ‚Äî Analyst (Tier-1) Upgrade/downgrade or target change from a tier-1 broker.
1500 ‚Äî Guidance / Pre-announcement Formal guidance change (press release/8-K) or quantified pre-earnings company commentary.
1500 ‚Äî CEO/CFO Change Leadership change with effective date (IR/filing).
1500 ‚Äî Buyback / Dividend New/expanded repurchase authorization, dividend initiation/raise, or special dividend.
1500 ‚Äî Major Contract / Partnership Material customer win, government award, or exclusive strategic partnership with numbers/terms.
1500 ‚Äî Index Change S&P/MSCI/FTSE inclusion/exclusion naming the company.
1500 ‚Äî Recall / Safety Product recall or safety advisory with scope and remediation (company/regulator).
1500 ‚Äî Data Breach / Cyber Company-confirmed breach/ransomware with operational or financial impact.
1500 ‚Äî IP Update (Non-final) Patent grant/expiry, injunction filing, or notable docket move (not a final ruling).
1200 ‚Äî Lawsuit / Strike Filed lawsuit, class certification, union strike/settlement confirmed by company/union/regulator.
1200 ‚Äî Investigation / Subpoena Agency investigation opened or subpoena disclosed (regulator/company).
1200 ‚Äî Short-Seller Report (Tier-1) Credible activist report with evidence and major-wire pickup.
500 ‚Äî Minor Update (fallback-only) Awards, small pilots, non-material PR/blog chatter. Exclude unless used strictly as fallback.
0 ‚Äî No News Nothing verifiable (‚â§72h). Use only for ETF-weight fallback.
Boost: If a reputable source explicitly states elevated/implied volatility due to a dated event, add +500 to that ticker‚Äôs NHSU.
Threshold: News picks require NHSU ‚â• 1000.


Step 2 ‚Äî Event Gate (avoid event landmines)
1. Exclude any ticker with a confirmed company earnings date inside 0‚Äì33 DTE.
2. Exclude tickers directly impacted by a dated macro/regulatory event within ~5 trading days relevant to their sector (e.g., Fed/Jackson Hole/CPI/Jobs for rates-sensitive; OPEC/EIA for Energy; notable FDA dates for Health Care) if the timing is confirmed.


Step 3 ‚Äî Build the basket (must return 3 per sector)
1. For each sector, rank tickers by NHSU (highest first).
2. Use only NHSU ‚â• 1000 for news picks.
3. If a sector has fewer than 3 qualified news picks, fill the remainder with fallback tickers from that sector‚Äôs CSV using ETF weight as a proxy (highest weights first).
4. Tie-breakers: higher ETF weight ‚Üí larger market cap ‚Üí alphabetical.


Results
Output (table only ‚Äî no links, no extra columns):
Sector | Ticker | News Heat (NHSU)
Exactly three rows per sector (27 total)
In the News Heat cell, write one of:
Catalyst: M&A (4000 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Product/Regulatory (3500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Upgrade/Downgrade (1500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Guidance (1500 [+500 if IV])

Fallback: Low heat (<1000)
Fallback: No news (0)

## Prompt

```text
You are my Credit-Spread Catalyst & Sanity Checker. Timezone: America/Los_Angeles.
Use absolute dates. When you fetch news/events, include links and sources.

INPUTS (paste below):
=== step7_complete_credit_spreads.json ===
{PASTE_JSON_HERE}
=== optional: step4_liquidity.json ===
{PASTE_JSON_HERE_OR_SKIP}
=== end ===

GOALS
For the top 20 spreads by combined_score:
  ‚Ä¢ Validate ‚Äúsane to trade today?‚Äù across catalysts, liquidity, and calendar risk.
  ‚Ä¢ Surface reasons to Delay/Avoid (not advice‚Äîjust risk signals).

CHECKLIST (per spread)
1) Calendar gates:
   - Earnings date between today and the spread‚Äôs expiration? Mark ‚ÄúEarnings-Inside-Trade‚Äù.
   - Ex-div date inside the trade window? Note potential assignment/price gap risk.
   - Sector macro events within 5 trading days (e.g., CPI/FOMC for Financials/Tech beta; OPEC/EIA for Energy; FDA calendar for biotech tickers). 
2) Fresh news (last 72h):
   - Pull 1‚Äì2 headlines that could move the underlying. Link them.
3) Liquidity sanity:
   - Confirm both legs have adequate OI (‚â•500 minimum; ‚â•1,000 preferred) and spreads not wider than 10¬¢ (tier-2) or 5¬¢ (tier-1 names). If step4_liquidity.json present, use Œî30 proxies; else infer from available fields.
4) Price sanity:
   - Credit ‚â§ width, ROI = credit/(width-credit). Recompute if needed; flag if odd (e.g., credit > width).
5) Risk note:
   - Summarize exposure (bear call = short upside; bull put = short downside) and distance-from-money (%). 
   - Note if IV regime seems low (<0.25) for premium selling or unusually high (>0.60) for gap risk.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- A ranked table with: 
  Ticker | Type (BearCall/BullPut) | Strikes | DTE | Credit | ROI% | Dist-OTM% | OI(min) | Spread sanity | Key Event(s) | Fresh News | Decision (Do / Delay / Avoid) + 1-line reason
- Then a short summary:
  ‚Ä¢ #Passing vs #Flagged 
  ‚Ä¢ Top 3 ‚ÄúDo‚Äù candidates with the clearest catalyst path (quiet calendar, sufficient OI, tight spreads)
  ‚Ä¢ Top 3 risk reasons observed (e.g., earnings inside window, macro landmines, thin OI)

RULES
- Information only; no trading advice. 
- Always include links for news/events you cite.
- If any required field is missing, mark ‚Äún/a‚Äù and continue; do not fabricate.
