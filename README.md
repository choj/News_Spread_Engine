Use the attached ticker basket files as the universe.
Select the top 4 tickers per sector/theme for trading 0‚Äì45 DTE credit spreads today.
Apply this strict filter framework (real-time only):
  1. Earnings & Macro Events (Scheduled) ‚Äì Must verify in today‚Äôs/week‚Äôs earnings calendars or official macro event schedules (Fed, CPI, jobs, OPEC, regulatory). Exclude if unverified.
  2. Headline & News Drivers ‚Äì Must be sourced from live headlines (upgrades/downgrades, strikes, lawsuits, product launches, sector disruptions). Rank by strength of catalyst.
  3. Implied Volatility Context (Event-Driven) ‚Äì Only flag if real-time news or analyst notes explicitly cite elevated IV or ‚Äúfear premium.‚Äù Ignore historical averages.
  4. Directional Tilt ‚Äì Classify bias as bullish, bearish, or neutral only if justified by current event/news flow. If unclear, mark as ‚ÄúNeutral.‚Äù
  5. Shock Disconnection / Factor Buckets  ‚Äì Ensure coverage across growth (Tech/Discretionary), rates (Financials/Utilities), commodities (Energy/Industrials), and defensives (Staples/Healthcare). Avoid clustering.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ AI Driven News Screener 

## Prompt

```text
You are my Credit-Spread Catalyst & Sanity Checker. Timezone: America/Los_Angeles.
Use absolute dates. When you fetch news/events, include links and sources.

INPUTS (paste below):
=== step7_complete_credit_spreads.json ===
{PASTE_JSON_HERE}
=== optional: step4_liquidity.json ===
{PASTE_JSON_HERE_OR_SKIP}
=== end ===

GOALS
For the top 20 spreads by combined_score:
  ‚Ä¢ Validate ‚Äúsane to trade today?‚Äù across catalysts, liquidity, and calendar risk.
  ‚Ä¢ Surface reasons to Delay/Avoid (not advice‚Äîjust risk signals).

CHECKLIST (per spread)
1) Calendar gates:
   - Earnings date between today and the spread‚Äôs expiration? Mark ‚ÄúEarnings-Inside-Trade‚Äù.
   - Ex-div date inside the trade window? Note potential assignment/price gap risk.
   - Sector macro events within 5 trading days (e.g., CPI/FOMC for Financials/Tech beta; OPEC/EIA for Energy; FDA calendar for biotech tickers). 
2) Fresh news (last 72h):
   - Pull 1‚Äì2 headlines that could move the underlying. Link them.
3) Liquidity sanity:
   - Confirm both legs have adequate OI (‚â•500 minimum; ‚â•1,000 preferred) and spreads not wider than 10¬¢ (tier-2) or 5¬¢ (tier-1 names). If step4_liquidity.json present, use Œî30 proxies; else infer from available fields.
4) Price sanity:
   - Credit ‚â§ width, ROI = credit/(width-credit). Recompute if needed; flag if odd (e.g., credit > width).
5) Risk note:
   - Summarize exposure (bear call = short upside; bull put = short downside) and distance-from-money (%). 
   - Note if IV regime seems low (<0.25) for premium selling or unusually high (>0.60) for gap risk.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- A ranked table with: 
  Ticker | Type (BearCall/BullPut) | Strikes | DTE | Credit | ROI% | Dist-OTM% | OI(min) | Spread sanity | Key Event(s) | Fresh News | Decision (Do / Delay / Avoid) + 1-line reason
- Then a short summary:
  ‚Ä¢ #Passing vs #Flagged 
  ‚Ä¢ Top 3 ‚ÄúDo‚Äù candidates with the clearest catalyst path (quiet calendar, sufficient OI, tight spreads)
  ‚Ä¢ Top 3 risk reasons observed (e.g., earnings inside window, macro landmines, thin OI)

RULES
- Information only; no trading advice. 
- Always include links for news/events you cite.
- If any required field is missing, mark ‚Äún/a‚Äù and continue; do not fabricate.
