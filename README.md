# üöÄ GPT5 vs Grok4 | Credit Spread Screener üî•

Work in Progress...  

1. Start with 9 sectors and scan for catalysts across earnings, filings, flows, sentiment, ratings, volatility, support/resistance, and relative strength. GPT-5 and Grok select the top 3 tickers per sector, 27 tickers total. 

2. Scripts pulls live market data from the tastytrade server, and uses Black-Scholes to get PoP and ROI. 

3. GPT-5 and Grok link news and events to each spread, producing entry and exit plans.

## ‚ñ™Ô∏è Prompt for top 3 tickers/sector.

### ‚óΩÔ∏è GROK 4 & ChatGPT 5
```python
Search for recent high volatility events and generate a Python script for a 45-ticker credit spread universe.

First, identify:
1. Stocks that moved >15% on earnings in the past 30 days
2. Current high volatility events (FDA, lawsuits, regulatory)
3. Recent IPOs with options trading
4. Verified unusual options activity

Then output ONLY this Python script format:

```python
# Monthly refresh script - Generated [current date]

OPTIMAL_45 = [
    # Tier 1: Always liquid (15)
    "SPY", "QQQ", "IWM", "AAPL", "MSFT", "NVDA", "AMZN", "META",

# Credit Spread Analysis & Trade Ranking Prompt

You are analyzing real credit spread opportunities with live options data. Your task is to score, rank, and generate actionable trade plans from the algorithm output.

## FOUNDATION (9 Analysis Points)

1. **Risk-Reward Validation:** Calculate R:R = Net_Credit / (Width - Net_Credit). Require R:R ‚â• 0.33 minimum for inclusion.

2. **Probability Assessment:** Evaluate PoP in context - 50-55% acceptable for high ROI, 60%+ preferred for conservative plays. Flag any PoP < 50% as speculative.

3. **Distance Buffer Analysis:** Classify Distance_From_Current: <0.5% = "thin", 0.5-2% = "adequate", >2% = "conservative". Prefer adequate+ for entry.

4. **DTE Optimization:** Score by timeframe: 7-21 DTE = optimal (+10 points), 22-33 = good (+5 points), 34-45 = acceptable (0 points), <7 = gamma risk (-10 points).

5. **Width Efficiency:** Evaluate spread width: $1-2 = narrow, $3-5 = sweet spot (+5 points), $6-10 = wide, >$10 = unwieldy (-5 points).

6. **ROI Reality Check:** Cap ROI analysis at 150% (higher often indicates thin liquidity). Score: >100% = excellent (+10), 75-100% = good (+5), 50-75% = fair (0), <50% = poor (-5).

7. **Sector Concentration:** Limit exposure - maximum 2 positions per sector, prefer diversification across 6+ sectors.

8. **Directional Consistency:** Group by bias - bull puts for bullish outlook, bear calls for bearish. Flag any directional mismatches for review.

9. **Liquidity Inference:** Favor large-cap tickers (GOOGL, JPM, UNH over smaller names) and standard strike intervals for better fills.

## PROCESS (6 Execution Steps)

**1. Data Validation & Cleaning:**
- Verify all numeric fields are properly formatted
- Flag any missing or suspicious data points
- Calculate derived metrics: Width = |Short - Long|, Max_Loss = Width - Net_Credit, R:R ratio

**2. Multi-Factor Scoring:**

Base_Score = PoP + (ROI_capped √ó 0.35) + (Distance_Buffer √ó 8) + DTE_bonus + Width_bonus + ROI_bonus
- PoP: Raw percentage (50-70 typical range)
- ROI_capped: min(ROI, 150) √ó 0.35 factor  
- Distance_Buffer: Percentage √ó 8 multiplier
- DTE_bonus: +10 (7-21), +5 (22-33), 0 (34-45), -10 (<7)
- Width_bonus: +5 ($3-5 width), -5 (>$10 width)
- ROI_bonus: +10 (>100%), +5 (75-100%), -5 (<50%)


**3. Risk Categorization:**
- **GREEN (Enter):** Score >80, PoP >50%, Distance >0.5%, R:R >0.33
- **YELLOW (Watch):** Score 65-80 or thin buffer but otherwise qualified
- **RED (Avoid):** Score <65, PoP <50%, or Distance <0.3%

**4. Portfolio Construction:**
- Select top 1-2 trades per sector maximum
- Ensure bull/bear balance reflects market outlook
- Prioritize diversification over individual trade perfection

**5. Entry Timing & Catalysts:** 
- Cross-reference with recent news/earnings calendar
- Identify immediate entries vs. watchlist candidates
- Note any time-sensitive catalysts

**6. Risk Management Framework:**
- Set profit targets: 25-50% of credit received
- Define stop losses: Technical breaks or 2x credit received
- Position sizing: 1-3% portfolio risk per trade maximum

## OUTPUT (3 Deliverables)

**1. Ranked Trade Table:**

| Rank | Ticker | Type | Strikes | DTE | PoP | ROI | R:R | Buffer | Score | Action | Risk Level |
|------|--------|------|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------|-------|--------|------------|
| 1    | JPM    | Bear Call | $300/$305 | 25 | 55.4% | 77.0% | 0.77 | 1.6% | 89.2 | ENTER | GREEN |


**2. Portfolio Allocation Plan:**
.json
{
  "total_recommendations": 15,
  "immediate_entries": 8,
  "watchlist": 5,
  "rejected": 2,
  "sector_breakdown": {
    "Financials": {"positions": 2, "allocation": "25%"},
    "Technology": {"positions": 2, "allocation": "25%"},
    "Healthcare": {"positions": 2, "allocation": "25%"}
  },
  "risk_metrics": {
    "total_margin_required": "$estimated",
    "max_loss_per_trade": "$calculated", 
    "portfolio_beta": "estimated_exposure"
  }
}


**3. Build a Individual Trade Plans Table:**
{
  "ticker": "JPM",
  "trade_summary": "Bear call spread $300/$305, 25 DTE",
  "entry_criteria": {
    "trigger": "On strength above $295",
    "max_entry_price": "$2.20 credit",
    "ideal_timing": "First 2 hours of trading"
  },
  "profit_management": {
    "target_1": "25% credit ($0.55) - close 50% position", 
    "target_2": "50% credit ($1.10) - close remainder",
    "max_hold": "21 DTE or 50% credit, whichever first"
  },
  "risk_management": {
    "stop_loss": "Break above $302 or 2x credit loss ($4.40)",
    "technical_stop": "Daily close above $303",
    "time_stop": "7 DTE - evaluate for roll or close"
  },
  "market_context": "Financials bullish on rate environment",
  "position_size": "1-2% portfolio risk maximum"
}


## EXECUTION PRIORITIES

**Immediate Action (GREEN trades):**
- Score >80 with adequate buffer
- Enter on next favorable market conditions
- Monitor for optimal entry timing

**Watchlist (YELLOW trades):**
- Good setups waiting for better entry
- Thin buffer requiring pullback/rally
- Monitor for improved risk-reward

**Avoid (RED trades):**
- Poor risk-reward metrics
- Insufficient probability of profit  
- Too close to current price

## CRITICAL RULES

- **No trade with PoP < 50%** - probability must favor credit spread seller
- **Minimum 0.5% buffer** unless exceptional ROI (>120%) and PoP (>65%)
- **R:R ratio ‚â• 0.33** - risk management fundamental
- **Maximum 2 positions per sector** - diversification requirement
- **Cap analysis at realistic ROI** - avoid thin liquidity traps
- **Time decay preference** - favor 7-21 DTE sweet spot
- **Position sizing discipline** - never exceed 3% portfolio risk per trade

**Success Target:** Generate 10-15 executable credit spreads with >65% aggregate probability of profit and proper portfolio risk management.

**Quality Standard:** Each recommendation must include specific entry criteria, profit targets, stop losses, and position sizing guidance based on real options data provided.
