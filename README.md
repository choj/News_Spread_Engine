## ‚ñ™Ô∏è Prompt for News Heat Ticker Picker

```text
Edge Prompt (Real-Time, No Guessing)

Date: [enter date & time]

Universe (must use): Only tickers in the attached CSVs: XLK, XLC, XLY, XLP, XLV, XLF, XLI, XLE, XLU.
Goal (must do): Pick exactly 3 tickers per sector (9 sectors = 27 total) for 0‚Äì33 DTE credit spreads today.
Output: Table only ‚Äî Sector | Ticker | News Heat (NHSU) ‚Äî exactly 3 rows per sector.

What I will fetch now (real-time, verifiable):
1. Company primary: IR/press releases/8-K (‚â§72h).
2. Regulators/courts: SEC/DOJ/FTC/ITC/FDA/CPSC/court dockets (‚â§72h).
3. Index providers: S&P/MSCI/FTSE inclusion/exclusion notices.
4. Macro calendars (official): Fed/Jackson Hole/FOMC; BLS CPI/Jobs; OPEC/EIA; notable FDA dates.
5. Tier-1 analysts: Upgrades/downgrades/target changes (firm named).
6. Credit agencies: S&P/Moody‚Äôs/Fitch rating/outlook changes.
7. Legal/labor/security: Lawsuits, class certs, investigations/subpoenas, strikes/ratifications, company-confirmed breaches.
8. Corporate actions: Buybacks/dividends (auths/raises), ex-div dates.
9. Market hygiene: Trading halts/delistings/bankruptcies; avoid unconfirmed big premarket gaps.

Hard rules (binary, pass/fail)

1. Live, timestamped, named-publisher source that names the ticker.
2. If not confirmed now by a primary or two majors (‚â§72h), treat as no news.
3. ‚â§24h preferred; allow ‚â§72h only if still active/relevant; drop >72h.
4. No IV inference ‚Äî no estimates/history/options-flow anecdotes.
5. Use IV only when a credible source quantifies it and ties it to a dated event.
6. De-dup events: many links about the same event count as one catalyst.

Action steps (score, gate, build)

Step 1 ‚Äî Score News (‚â§24h preferred; fallback ‚â§72h).
Assign one NHSU per ticker from its strongest verified catalyst:
4000 ‚Äî M&A (definitive/signed/acknowledged).
3500 ‚Äî Product launch/major dated event or final regulatory/litigation decision.
1500 ‚Äî Analyst (tier-1) or guidance/pre-announcement (PR/8-K) or CEO/CFO change or buyback/dividend or major contract/partnership or index change or recall/safety or data breach or IP update (non-final).
1200 ‚Äî Lawsuit/strike or investigation/subpoena or tier-1 short-seller report (picked up by majors).
500 ‚Äî Minor update (fallback-only).
0 ‚Äî No verifiable ‚â§72h news.
Boost: If a reputable source explicitly quantifies event-linked IV, add +500.
Threshold: NHSU ‚â• 1000 required for a news pick.

Step 2 ‚Äî Event Gate (avoid landmines).
1. Exclude tickers with earnings inside 0‚Äì33 DTE.
2. Exclude tickers directly hit by dated macro/regulatory within ~5 trading days (Fed/CPI/Jobs for rates; OPEC/EIA for Energy; notable FDA for Health Care) if timing is confirmed.

Step 3 ‚Äî Build the basket (must return 3 per sector).
1. Rank by NHSU (3s first, then 2s). Use only NHSU ‚â• 1000 for news picks.
2. If <3, fallback to top ETF weights from that sector‚Äôs CSV (no catalyst text).
3. Tie-breakers: higher ETF weight ‚Üí larger market cap ‚Üí alphabetical.

Allowed ‚ÄúNews Heat‚Äù cell values:
Catalyst: M&A (4000 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Product/Regulatory (3500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Upgrade/Downgrade (1500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Guidance (1500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: CEO/CFO Change (1500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Buyback/Dividend (1500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Contract/Partnership (1500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Index Change (1500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Recall/Safety (1500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Data Breach (1500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: IP Update (1500 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Lawsuit/Strike (1200 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Investigation/Subpoena (1200 [+500 if IV])
Catalyst: Short-Seller Report (1200 [+500 if IV])
Fallback: Low heat (<1000)
Fallback: No news (0)

## ‚ñ™Ô∏è Prompt

```text
You are my Credit-Spread Catalyst & Sanity Checker. Timezone: America/Los_Angeles.
Use absolute dates. When you fetch news/events, include links and sources.

INPUTS (paste below):
=== step7_complete_credit_spreads.json ===
{PASTE_JSON_HERE}
=== optional: step4_liquidity.json ===
{PASTE_JSON_HERE_OR_SKIP}
=== end ===

GOALS
For the top 20 spreads by combined_score:
  ‚Ä¢ Validate ‚Äúsane to trade today?‚Äù across catalysts, liquidity, and calendar risk.
  ‚Ä¢ Surface reasons to Delay/Avoid (not advice‚Äîjust risk signals).

CHECKLIST (per spread)
1) Calendar gates:
   - Earnings date between today and the spread‚Äôs expiration? Mark ‚ÄúEarnings-Inside-Trade‚Äù.
   - Ex-div date inside the trade window? Note potential assignment/price gap risk.
   - Sector macro events within 5 trading days (e.g., CPI/FOMC for Financials/Tech beta; OPEC/EIA for Energy; FDA calendar for biotech tickers). 
2) Fresh news (last 72h):
   - Pull 1‚Äì2 headlines that could move the underlying. Link them.
3) Liquidity sanity:
   - Confirm both legs have adequate OI (‚â•500 minimum; ‚â•1,000 preferred) and spreads not wider than 10¬¢ (tier-2) or 5¬¢ (tier-1 names). If step4_liquidity.json present, use Œî30 proxies; else infer from available fields.
4) Price sanity:
   - Credit ‚â§ width, ROI = credit/(width-credit). Recompute if needed; flag if odd (e.g., credit > width).
5) Risk note:
   - Summarize exposure (bear call = short upside; bull put = short downside) and distance-from-money (%). 
   - Note if IV regime seems low (<0.25) for premium selling or unusually high (>0.60) for gap risk.

OUTPUT FORMAT
- A ranked table with: 
  Ticker | Type (BearCall/BullPut) | Strikes | DTE | Credit | ROI% | Dist-OTM% | OI(min) | Spread sanity | Key Event(s) | Fresh News | Decision (Do / Delay / Avoid) + 1-line reason
- Then a short summary:
  ‚Ä¢ #Passing vs #Flagged 
  ‚Ä¢ Top 3 ‚ÄúDo‚Äù candidates with the clearest catalyst path (quiet calendar, sufficient OI, tight spreads)
  ‚Ä¢ Top 3 risk reasons observed (e.g., earnings inside window, macro landmines, thin OI)

RULES
- Information only; no trading advice. 
- Always include links for news/events you cite.
- If any required field is missing, mark ‚Äún/a‚Äù and continue; do not fabricate.
