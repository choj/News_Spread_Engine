# Credit Spread Selection Prompt

You are tasked with identifying 27 high-probability credit spread candidates (3 per sector) using only web search and public information analysis.


# FOUNDATION (9 Core Search Points)

1. **Sector Holdings Discovery:** Search "[sector ETF] holdings 2025" for XLC, XLY, XLP, XLE, XLF, XLV, XLI, XLK, XLU. Also search "best [sector name] stocks 2025" to find non-SPDR alternatives.

2. **Earnings Calendar Scan:** Search "[ticker] earnings date" and "[ticker] Q3 2025 earnings" to identify and exclude any ticker reporting within 35 days.

3. **Recent SEC Filings:** Search "site:sec.gov [ticker] 8-K" for material events in past 7 days. Prioritize stable operational updates over major restructuring.

4. **Institutional Activity:** Search "[ticker] unusual options activity today" and "[ticker] dark pool activity" to identify where smart money is positioning.

5. **Technical Sentiment:** Search "[ticker] technical analysis" on financial sites to find current RSI readings and trend descriptions (overbought/oversold/neutral).

6. **Analyst Movement:** Search "[ticker] analyst upgrade downgrade this week" to capture recent institutional sentiment shifts.

7. **Volatility Context:** Search "[ticker] implied volatility" and "[ticker] options volume" to identify elevated premium selling opportunities.

8. **Support/Resistance Mentions:** Search "[ticker] key levels" and "[ticker] support resistance" to find commonly cited price levels from technical analysts.

9. **Comparative Strength:** Search "[ticker] vs [sector ETF] performance" to identify relative outperformers/underperformers within each sector.


#PROCESS (6 Execution Steps)

**1. Triple Source Verification:** For each data point, find 3 different sources mentioning similar information. If only 1 source exists, mark as "unverified" in output.

**2. News Recency Scoring:**
  - Last 24 hours = 3 points
  - Last 3 days = 2 points
  - Last 7 days = 1 point
  - Older = 0 points
  - Prioritize tickers with score ‚â•4 from multiple news items

**3. Sentiment Aggregation:** Count bullish vs bearish mentions across all search results:
  - Strong directional bias (>70% one direction)** = ideal for credit spreads
  - Mixed sentiment (40-60%)** = avoid
  - Search terms:** "bullish on [ticker]", "bearish on [ticker]", "[ticker] price target"

**4. Options Activity Validation:** Search "[ticker] put call ratio" and "[ticker] options flow". High put/call ratio (>1.5) suggests bear call setup; low (<0.7) suggests bull put.

**5. Volatility Rank Approximation:** Search "[ticker] IV rank" or "[ticker] implied volatility historical". If current IV mentioned as "elevated" or "above average" in multiple sources, mark as favorable.

**6. Risk Event Scanning:** Search "[ticker] FDA approval", "[ticker] lawsuit", "[ticker] merger", "[ticker] regulatory". Exclude any ticker with binary events within 45 days.

# OUTPUT (3 Requirements)

**1. Confidence Scoring:

- HIGH (7-9 verified data points found)
- MEDIUM (4-6 verified data points found)
- LOW (1-3 verified data points found)

##2. JSON Structure with verifiable data only:

json{
  "scan_timestamp": "2025-08-25T10:00:00Z",
  "total_tickers_analyzed": 120,
  "final_selections": 27,
  "sectors": {
    "Communication Services": {
      "etf": "XLC",
      "alternatives_checked": ["FCOM", "VOX"],
      "tickers": [
        {
          "symbol": "META",
          "confidence": "HIGH",
          "data_points_found": 8,
          "earnings_days_away": 89,
          "recent_news_sentiment": "bullish",
          "analyst_actions": "2 upgrades this week",
          "options_activity": "unusual call buying detected",
          "technical_mention": "oversold per 3 sources",
          "suggested_bias": "bull-put",
          "sources": ["reuters.com", "benzinga.com", "optionshawk.com"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

**3. Fallback Protocol:** If cannot find 3 HIGH/MEDIUM confidence tickers in a sector:
  - First expand to top 10 holdings of sector ETF
  - Then check competing sector ETFs (iShares, Vanguard)
  - Finally include best available with "LOW" confidence flag
  - Never fabricate data - mark as "insufficient_data" if needed



# SEARCH EXECUTION PATTERNS

**1. For each ticker, execute in this order:**
  - "[ticker] stock price today" - Verify it's trading
  - "[ticker] earnings date 2025" - Event avoidance
  - "[ticker] news this week" - Catalyst check
  - "[ticker] unusual options activity" - Smart money
  - "[ticker] analyst rating change" - Institutional view
  - "[ticker] technical analysis oversold overbought" - Entry timing
  - "[ticker] implied volatility" - Premium check

# CRITICAL RULES

  - Never invent data - use "not_found" for missing information
  - Each ticker must have at least 3 verified data points
  - Prioritize liquid names mentioned across multiple sources
  - If conflicting information found, note it explicitly
  - Timestamp all searches to acknowledge data delay

Focus on finding real, verifiable information that suggests directional bias and elevated options activity.
Quality over quantity - better to have 20 excellent candidates than 27 mediocre ones.

# Credit Spread Analysis & Trade Ranking Prompt

You are analyzing real credit spread opportunities with live options data. Your task is to score, rank, and generate actionable trade plans from the algorithm output.

## FOUNDATION (9 Analysis Points)

1. **Risk-Reward Validation:** Calculate R:R = Net_Credit / (Width - Net_Credit). Require R:R ‚â• 0.33 minimum for inclusion.

2. **Probability Assessment:** Evaluate PoP in context - 50-55% acceptable for high ROI, 60%+ preferred for conservative plays. Flag any PoP < 50% as speculative.

3. **Distance Buffer Analysis:** Classify Distance_From_Current: <0.5% = "thin", 0.5-2% = "adequate", >2% = "conservative". Prefer adequate+ for entry.

4. **DTE Optimization:** Score by timeframe: 7-21 DTE = optimal (+10 points), 22-33 = good (+5 points), 34-45 = acceptable (0 points), <7 = gamma risk (-10 points).

5. **Width Efficiency:** Evaluate spread width: $1-2 = narrow, $3-5 = sweet spot (+5 points), $6-10 = wide, >$10 = unwieldy (-5 points).

6. **ROI Reality Check:** Cap ROI analysis at 150% (higher often indicates thin liquidity). Score: >100% = excellent (+10), 75-100% = good (+5), 50-75% = fair (0), <50% = poor (-5).

7. **Sector Concentration:** Limit exposure - maximum 2 positions per sector, prefer diversification across 6+ sectors.

8. **Directional Consistency:** Group by bias - bull puts for bullish outlook, bear calls for bearish. Flag any directional mismatches for review.

9. **Liquidity Inference:** Favor large-cap tickers (GOOGL, JPM, UNH over smaller names) and standard strike intervals for better fills.

## PROCESS (6 Execution Steps)

**1. Data Validation & Cleaning:**
- Verify all numeric fields are properly formatted
- Flag any missing or suspicious data points
- Calculate derived metrics: Width = |Short - Long|, Max_Loss = Width - Net_Credit, R:R ratio

**2. Multi-Factor Scoring:**

Base_Score = PoP + (ROI_capped √ó 0.35) + (Distance_Buffer √ó 8) + DTE_bonus + Width_bonus + ROI_bonus
- PoP: Raw percentage (50-70 typical range)
- ROI_capped: min(ROI, 150) √ó 0.35 factor  
- Distance_Buffer: Percentage √ó 8 multiplier
- DTE_bonus: +10 (7-21), +5 (22-33), 0 (34-45), -10 (<7)
- Width_bonus: +5 ($3-5 width), -5 (>$10 width)
- ROI_bonus: +10 (>100%), +5 (75-100%), -5 (<50%)


**3. Risk Categorization:**
- **GREEN (Enter):** Score >80, PoP >50%, Distance >0.5%, R:R >0.33
- **YELLOW (Watch):** Score 65-80 or thin buffer but otherwise qualified
- **RED (Avoid):** Score <65, PoP <50%, or Distance <0.3%

**4. Portfolio Construction:**
- Select top 1-2 trades per sector maximum
- Ensure bull/bear balance reflects market outlook
- Prioritize diversification over individual trade perfection

**5. Entry Timing & Catalysts:** 
- Cross-reference with recent news/earnings calendar
- Identify immediate entries vs. watchlist candidates
- Note any time-sensitive catalysts

**6. Risk Management Framework:**
- Set profit targets: 25-50% of credit received
- Define stop losses: Technical breaks or 2x credit received
- Position sizing: 1-3% portfolio risk per trade maximum

## OUTPUT (3 Deliverables)

**1. Ranked Trade Table:**

| Rank | Ticker | Type | Strikes | DTE | PoP | ROI | R:R | Buffer | Score | Action | Risk Level |

}


## EXECUTION PRIORITIES

**Immediate Action (GREEN trades):**
- Score >80 with adequate buffer
- Enter on next favorable market conditions
- Monitor for optimal entry timing

**Watchlist (YELLOW trades):**
- Good setups waiting for better entry
- Thin buffer requiring pullback/rally
- Monitor for improved risk-reward

**Avoid (RED trades):**
- Poor risk-reward metrics
- Insufficient probability of profit  
- Too close to current price

## CRITICAL RULES

- **No trade with PoP < 50%** - probability must favor credit spread seller
- **Minimum 0.5% buffer** unless exceptional ROI (>120%) and PoP (>65%)
- **R:R ratio ‚â• 0.33** - risk management fundamental
- **Maximum 2 positions per sector** - diversification requirement
- **Cap analysis at realistic ROI** - avoid thin liquidity traps
- **Time decay preference** - favor 7-21 DTE sweet spot
- **Position sizing discipline** - never exceed 3% portfolio risk per trade

**Success Target:** Generate 10-15 executable credit spreads with >65% aggregate probability of profit and proper portfolio risk management.

**Quality Standard:** Each recommendation must include specific entry criteria, profit targets, stop losses, and position sizing guidance based on real options data provided.
